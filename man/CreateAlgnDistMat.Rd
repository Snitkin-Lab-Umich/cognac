\title{Create Algnment Distance Matrix}
\arguments{
\item{msaPath}{Path to the alignment}

\item{method}{Method for calculating distance: "raw", or "shared."}

\item{isCore}{Logical to specify whether to remove gap positions from the 
alignment to create the core genome.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix
}
\description{
This function reads in the path to a multiple sequence alignment. The
  pairwise alignment distances for each sequence are returned. The 
  pairwise distances are calculated in parallel via the RcppParallel 
  package.
